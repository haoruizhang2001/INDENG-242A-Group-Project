Once we find something to work on, we can edit the repo name into something else
Basic: a comparative study of different ML methods in a specific of financial market


Baseline model: ARIMA
Linear regression (PCA)
RF/Gradient boosting
Neural Network
Time series model

Novelty:
Neural network
specific/useful factors in the regression
240 project (optimization method)
room for discussion and exploration

Final results:
talk about the effectiveness(accuracy)/ mechanism (why this work/why not)
discussion engaging with the financial knowledge

Steps/Workload

—> Choose topic! Financial market?
1. data (raw data, control variable, proxy variables, others)
	→ Big shitty work
2. Baseline model construction
	→ algorithm
NN, Factors
Disucssion
regarding ML methods effectiveness
discussion related to finance
